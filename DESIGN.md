## My Classes

  - **Admins** have the ability to create/delete and update a class.  The admin class data will be linked live to individual instructor classes.  This means if the instructor makes changes to the class the changes will be apparent in all linked instructor classes.  If an instructor has modified the class data which an admin later updates, priority will be given to the instructor's modifications unless the admin change includes a locked field.  In the case of a locked field, the admin information will always be used.
 
   - **Instructors** can individualy modify an existing class.  Any changes made to a class only apply to the individual instructor.  The class data will be a live and any updates will be visible to students.
 
 - **Students** will see all classes that they linked to a group that they are in.  When a student clicks on the view session button it will show them the student content (pre-survey, lesson, post-survey, etc).  The content that the students see will be linked live to the instructors class data.  This means if the instructor changes the class material, then the changes will be reflected in the student content.
